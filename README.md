# moller_analysis
## 2019 version
Starting repository for moller polarimetry analysis. We can transfer this to Simona once it's usable.

I guess it's worth stating but my intent is to eventually use this without having to go through ROOT. Let's call that Moller_Analysis v2.0. I want to create a main(), move things to methods if needed, and allow the program to take arguments such as anpow and compile with g++.
